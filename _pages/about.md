I am currently working as the Schmidt AI for Science Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell University. I received my PhD (2023) in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University on the topic of **reliable** and **trustworthy** machine learning with particular focus on data-driven **manufacturing** and **industrial** applications. I was the Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological Univiersity (2024).

My research interests are broadly across machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), including their explainability, robustness, and reliability, ensuring beneficial outcomes for people and society. Topics of interest include:

- **AI for Plant Science:** Developing ``multimodal plant agents'' for examining plant genotypes, phenotypes, pathology, and processes to combat agricultural and economical challenges due to climate change.
- **Explainable AI:** Computing feature attribution to output prediction for explaining deep models, applicable for the tasks like anomaly root cause localization.
- **Adversarial Robustness:** Exploring ML model resilience against perturbations, including adversarial attack and countermeasures, formal verification, and robust training.
- **Optimization:** Designing optimization algorithms, encompassing Bayesian optimization, math programming, and multi-objective optimization, in the realm of hyper-parameter optimization and formal verification.
- **Any-shot Learning:** Addressing the model accuracy degradation caused by data scarcity with data augmentation and semi-supervised approaches, for zero-shot, few-shot and imbalanced classification.
- **Anomaly/Fault Diagnosis:** Diagnosing anomaly and fault datasets including the tasks of classification, detection and localization, particularly for industrial process optimization and control.
